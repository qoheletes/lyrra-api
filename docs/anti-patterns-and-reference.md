# Anti-patterns & Quick Reference

## Anti-patterns — common AI-agent mistakes

If you're an agent reviewing a diff, check for these. Each is a real failure mode I've
seen agents introduce.

| Anti-pattern | Why it's wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `requests.get(...)` inside `async def` | Blocks the event loop. `requests` is sync. | Use `httpx.AsyncClient` or `await run_in_threadpool(requests.get, ...)`. |
| `time.sleep` / `open()` / sync DB driver inside `async def` | Same — blocks the loop. | Use the async equivalent (`asyncio.sleep`, `aiofiles`, async driver). |
| `from jose import jwt` | `python-jose` is unmaintained. | `import jwt` (PyJWT). |
| `from async_asgi_testclient import TestClient` | Unmaintained. | `httpx.AsyncClient` + `ASGITransport`. |
| `model_config = ConfigDict(json_encoders={...})` | Deprecated in Pydantic v2. | `@field_serializer` or `Annotated[T, PlainSerializer(...)]`. |
| `Field(ge=18, default=None)` | Constraint contradicts the default. | Pick required or optional, not both. |
| `def get_user(id: int = Depends(...))` (default-arg form) | Legacy; gotchas with default values. | `user: Annotated[User, Depends(...)]`. |
| Catching `Exception` around a route's body | Hides bugs and turns 500s into silent 200s. | Catch the specific exception class; raise `HTTPException` with a meaningful status. |
| `BackgroundTasks` for anything you'd page on | No retry, dies with the worker. | Use Celery / Arq / RQ. |
| Calling a sync ORM session inside `async def` | Blocks the loop, may deadlock the pool. | Use `AsyncSession`. |
| Returning a Pydantic model and *also* setting `response_model=` to that same class | Model gets constructed twice (validate + serialize). | Either return a `dict`/ORM row and let `response_model` validate, or drop `response_model` and trust the return type. |
| Importing across domains via deep paths (`from src.auth.service.user import ...`) | Tight coupling, hard to refactor. | `from src.auth import service as auth_service`. |
| Reusing one `BaseSettings` for the whole app | Hard to reason about, every domain reads every var. | One `BaseSettings` per domain. |
| Mocking the database in integration tests | Mock/prod divergence eventually fires in prod. | Use a real DB (testcontainers, ephemeral schema) and `dependency_overrides` for auth/external services. |

| Scenario                             | Solution                                          |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Non-blocking I/O                     | `async def` route with `await`                    |
| Blocking I/O (no async client)       | `def` route (sync, runs in threadpool)            |
| Sync library inside async route      | `await run_in_threadpool(fn, *args)`              |
| CPU-intensive work                   | Celery / Arq / RQ worker process                  |
| Request validation against DB        | Dependency that loads + validates + returns       |
| Reuse validation across routes       | Chain dependencies                                |
| Inject dependency in modern style    | `Annotated[T, Depends(...)]`                      |
| Per-request dep caching              | Default behavior — same `Depends(x)` runs once    |
| Per-domain config                    | One `BaseSettings` subclass per domain            |
| Custom datetime serialization        | `@field_serializer`                               |
| Fire-and-forget short task           | `BackgroundTasks`                                 |
| Reliable / scheduled / heavy task    | Celery / Arq / RQ                                 |
| JWT decode                           | `PyJWT` (`import jwt`)                            |
| Async DB                             | SQLAlchemy 2.0 async (`AsyncSession`)             |
| HTTP test client                     | `httpx.AsyncClient` + `ASGITransport`             |
| Swap dep in tests                    | `app.dependency_overrides[dep] = fake`            |
| Lint + format                        | `ruff check --fix` + `ruff format`                |
